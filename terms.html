            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">7. Broker/Partner Payout Terms</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">If you participate in our Partner Program as a broker:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
                <li><strong>Commission Models:</strong> You choose one of two models:
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
                        <li>$500 one-time per referred customer (paid once, after the hold period)</li>
                        <li>$50/month recurring per active referred customer (paid monthly, after the hold period for each payment)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>60-Day Hold Period:</strong> All commissions are held for 60 days after the FIRST successful customer payment date before becoming eligible for payout. For recurring commissions, each monthly invoice has its own 60-day hold period. This protects against chargebacks, refunds, and disputes.</li>
                <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Commissions become eligible ("Due to Pay") only after:
                    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mt-2">
                        <li>The 60-day hold period has passed from the payment date</li>
                        <li>The customer's payment has not been refunded or charged back</li>
                        <li>The customer's subscription is still active (for recurring commissions)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="mt-2"><strong>Payout eligibility is determined by LienDeadline's internal tracking and payment processor events.</strong></p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Refunds & Chargebacks:</strong> If a customer refunds, disputes, or charges back a payment, the associated commission does not become eligible for payout. Failed payments also void unpaid earnings. If a subscription cancels or becomes past-due, recurring commissions stop for that customer until payments resume.</li>
                <li><strong>Payout Processing:</strong> Admin processes payouts in batches. Each batch contains one or more eligible commission events and is marked paid together with a timestamp and optional transaction reference.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment Methods:</strong> We support PayPal, Wise (TransferWise), Revolut, SEPA Transfer, SWIFT/Wire Transfer, and Cryptocurrency. You must provide valid payment information in your broker dashboard.</li>
                <li><strong>Tax Obligations:</strong> You are responsible for reporting and paying taxes on all commissions received. We may request tax identification information (W9, VAT, etc.) for payments over $600/year (US) or equivalent.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">8. Governing Law & Venue</h2>
